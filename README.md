# [Social Network API](https://github.com/domdecap/social-network-api)



## Description

This is a working social network API. It allows new visitors to create a user. It then allows users to update their user name, add friends, delete friends, or delete their user all together. Users can post thoughts and reactions to other users' thoughts. Users can also delete their thoughts and reactions. It is written using Mongoose as the MongoDB library.

## Technologies

I used JavaScript, Node, MongoDB, Mongoose, and Insomnia.

## Install

Prerequisites: [NodeJs](https://nodejs.org/en) ```v20.12.2```

1. Clone this repo to your local machine.
2. Open in code editior (I used VS Code).
3. Open a new instance of the integrated terminal.
4. Run ```npm i``` to install dependencies.
5. Run ```npm start``` to start the server.

## Usage

After the server is running, you will be able to run all of the test routes to be sure they work. Follow along in the demo video below for examples.

## Demo










## Contributions

I utilized ChatGPT to help create and debug the route and controller files.
